# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two list forom the user

### Step 2: 
import the math module

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula ![Screenshot 2023-06-15 083917](https://github.com/praveenmax55/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/113497509/232d657d-a935-45af-8328-1562df388e0b)

### Step 4: 
print the value useing the format function

### Step 5: 
Stop the program

### PROGRAM:
```python

import math
l1=(4,2)
l2=(10,6)
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print(round(distance,2))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:

Thus distance between two points are sucessfully executed
